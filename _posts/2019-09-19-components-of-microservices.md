#### Components of Microservices {#markdown-header-modules}

Let us look at components of Microservices , which we will be learning, We will be creating

Below is the diagram of the components we will be building.

  * **Microservices :** user-service and todo-services.
  * **Config Server:** All Microservices on startup will refer to config server for their configurations.
  * **Api Gateway:** A centralized way to access all the microservices , A front facing unit for all the clients. Also responsible for common services via Filters viz. Authentication , capturing user info in log before hitting services and many other.
  * **Feign Client** Helps to remove boilerplate restTemplate code
  * **Ribbon** Along with feign client helps to load balance the application
  * **Naming Server: Eureka:** All of the microservices on startup will let naming server know about their existence. Naming server will know their address /location/ ip . Whenever one microservices calls another via ribbon/feign , it will check naming server for existence on another service and return correct one. Because there can be multiple instances of any microservice it helps as in load balancing .
  * **Spring Cloud Sleuth** As the name suggests ,sleuth is a detective, To every incoming request it adds tracing mechanism , i.e. traceid . With all logs printing this trace id. We can track over which microservice instance request has traveled.
  * **Rabbit MQ** Just to keep track of all traces coming of incoming request. It keeps all these traces at one centralized place.
  * **Zipkin** UI for looking tracing the entire journey of request.
  * **Hystrix** A fallback mechanism for any failing services.

Note: All of the above Microservices are created as a part of tutorial , You can find entire tutorial at [Spring Boot REST API and Microservices](https://www.udemy.com/course/spring-boot-and-rest-api/?couponCode=SPRING50) .

The source code of the above microservice architecture is present at [Github.](https://github.com/CODINGSAINT/microservices)
