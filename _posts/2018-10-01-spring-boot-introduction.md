<span style="font-weight: 400;">Spring Boot is easy, robust and simple way to create production grade standalone application that you can run. </span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">It is a very opinionated approach of Spring boot library and third party application with a motive of starting an application without much configuration. Spring Boot handles most of the configuration required for Spring and third party libraries.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Tough it handles most of your configuration by itself , it’s opinionated approach doesn’t come in your way to override default configuration , and you can still add custom configuration on your own.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Running a Spring Boot application is as easy as running a jar file.</span>

<li style="font-weight: 400;">
  <span style="font-weight: 400;">Java Version 8</span>
</li>

<li style="font-weight: 400;">
  <span style="font-weight: 400;">Servlet Container as Tomcat 8.5 /Jetty 9.4 /Undertow 1.3</span>
</li>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">While proceeding further we do expect that you have Java version 8, Maven 3.2 or Gradle installed on your system.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">It is expected that as a reader you do have a basic knowledge of Java and  Maven . A knowledge on Spring is a big plus but you can learn it along the course. Things will be kept as simple as possible, with links to full source code. </span>
