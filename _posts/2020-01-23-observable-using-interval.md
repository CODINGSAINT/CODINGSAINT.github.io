Interval are timed observables. They tell to perform an event at regular basis. Intervals will help to perform a task regularly.

Below code is a way to create a Timed interval example.

{% gist ba2f2fd9d301642ec7e8c87ba8e7e89f %}


The demo Interval will keep getting invoked at regular interval of a second. We have added a sleep that that we can see the events getting logged.

Since it is observed computation thread so sleep will help us in seeing the logs.
