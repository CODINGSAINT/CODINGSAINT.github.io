Observable normally gets created once the code executes, Observable using defer , defers the creation of Observable. It waits till a subscription is done.

Below are main property of Observable using defer.

  1. <span style="font-weight: 400;">Creates new observable every time on subscription</span>
  2. <span style="font-weight: 400;">No Observable is createdÂ  until subscription</span>

Below is the code showing Observable using defer

{% gist ee75cc833bbd4072d421fa53f91b31ea %}


Here intentionally we are subscribing 2 times to show that each time Observable is created. You can also see that defer is taking _fromIterable_ to create the observable. This will stop creating defer until we subscribe. Once subscribed _Observable.fromInterable_ code will be invoked
